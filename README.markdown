VX Animation Module
---

This is a JavaScript browser framework that a wrote some years back which contains an animation module. In fact, the animation module has no dependencies on any framework. It uses a declarative style for defining animations, and these can be chained by firing another animation when the current one ends using a build in callback for animation end. Open up the examples to see how I put them together.
